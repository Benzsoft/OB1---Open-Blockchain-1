# OB1: Our Blockchain 1

Welcome to OB1 (Our Blockchain 1), a foundational blockchain implementation designed to demystify and illustrate the core concepts of blockchain technology. Built with Python and Flask, OB1 offers hands-on experience in understanding how blockchains operate.

## Features

- **Blockchain Initialization**: Set up and manage a basic blockchain structure.
- **Transaction Management**: Add and record transactions in a block.
- **Proof of Work**: Implement a simple proof-of-work algorithm to secure the blockchain.
- **Mining Blocks**: Understand the process of mining and adding new blocks.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Interact with the blockchain through an intuitive web interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and Flask installed on your system. If not, you can install Flask using pip:

```
pip install Flask
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OB1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd OB1
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
2. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

- **Create Transactions**: Add new transactions through the `/transactions/new` endpoint.
- **Mine a Block**: Mine a new block by accessing the `/mine` endpoint.
- **View the Blockchain**: See the entire blockchain at the `/chain` endpoint.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automatic Block Mining**: Implementing a scheduler for automatic mining.
2. **Smart Contract Functionality**: Introducing basic smart contract capabilities.
3. **Consensus Algorithm Improvement**: Upgrading to a more efficient consensus mechanism.
4. **Enhanced Security Features**: Adding advanced security measures.
5. **Decentralized Node Network**: Creating a network where multiple nodes can join and interact.
